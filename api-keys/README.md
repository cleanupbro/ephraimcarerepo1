# api-keys/

API key documentation. Maps what keys this project needs, where to get them, and where they're used.

**⚠️ NEVER put actual key values in any file in this folder. Only names and metadata.**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `registry.md` | Master list of all API keys and credentials |

Actual values go in `.env` files (gitignored) and platform dashboards.
