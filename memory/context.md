# Project Context

## Project Name
Ephraim Care Website

## What It Does
Professional NDIS disability and mental health support services website for Ephraim Care Pty Ltd. This is the **public-facing front-end** — service pages, contact/referral forms, and information for NDIS participants. Form submissions trigger automated notifications via n8n webhooks. The admin portal lives in a separate repo (`ephraimcare-portal-2026`).

## Who It's For
- **Primary:** NDIS participants and families seeking disability and mental health support services in Western & Southwestern Sydney
- **Secondary:** Referral partners, support coordinators, and healthcare professionals

## Why It Exists
Ephraim Care needed a modern, NDIS-compliant website that showcases their 8 core services, handles online referrals, manages participant data, and automates admin notifications — replacing manual processes with a streamlined digital platform.
