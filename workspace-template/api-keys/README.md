# api-keys/

**API key references for this project. NEVER store actual keys here — only names and metadata.**

Actual keys live in `.env` files and platform dashboards (Vercel, Supabase, etc).
This folder documents WHAT keys exist, WHERE to get them, and HOW they're used.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `registry.md` | Master list of all API keys, tokens, and credentials needed |

## Rules

- **NEVER** put actual key values in any file in this folder
- Only store: key name, purpose, where to get it, which env var to set
- Update `registry.md` when adding or removing any API/service integration
